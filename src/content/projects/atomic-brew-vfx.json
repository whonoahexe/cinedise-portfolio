  "description": "A commercial scene was created inspired by the visual style of Oppenheimer, featuring a dramatic nuclear explosion simulation. The effect was achieved using fluid dynamics and particle simulations to replicate the scale, intensity, and cloud formation of a real blast. Careful attention was given to lighting, texture, and compositing to ensure the explosion felt integrated and cinematic. The resulting visual is a high-impact, photorealistic recreation that captures the raw power and atmospheric tension of the original inspiration.",
