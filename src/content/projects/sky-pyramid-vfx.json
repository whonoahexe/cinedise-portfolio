  "description": "Sky Pyramid is a fusion of fantasy, sci-fi, and futuristic genres. Fueling my passion for pushing creative boundaries, I crafted this environment to unveil a surreal world. It's akin to one's imagination—a dream, a place existing in another realm. I brought it to life using software like Blender and After Effects for compositing.",
