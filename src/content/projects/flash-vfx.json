  "description": "The environment was meticulously created in Blender, providing a realistic and immersive setting for the live-action compositing. Color grading was executed in DaVinci Resolve to achieve a polished, cinematic look. Advanced compositing was performed in After Effects, seamlessly integrating live-action footage with the 3D elements. Detailed painting and enhancements were added through Ebsynth and Photoshop, ensuring a visually rich and dynamic final result. This multi-software approach ensured a cohesive and professional final product that effectively blended live-action and digital elements.",
